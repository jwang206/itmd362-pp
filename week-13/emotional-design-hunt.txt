# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-13/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral:lights always makes people feel safe. 

* Behavioral: function as lamp, reading light besides my desk, and decore.

* Reflective: this light was a gift from my beft friend, and she knew I like to decoreating my room. 

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

1. similar to the string lights, colors can give people diffrent emotion. 
2. this string lights requires structure. We should work on the structure of our project. give our code a sturcture, so we don't lost track of where we are when we look at each other's work.
3. the final look of our project should look pasionate and welcoming like the string lights.
